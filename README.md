# cursepacker

Downloads a cursepack from a pack URL...

## Use

```
python3 cursepacker.py <pack download url>
```

This will extract the pack to the <nameofpack>/minecraft directory and download all the mod files required for the pack.

Simply install forge (in general) and point the vanilla launcher "game directory" at the <nameofpack>/minecraft directory.
